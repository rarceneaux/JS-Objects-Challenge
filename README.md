# JS Obejects Challenge

You have volunteered your time to a local political candidate, Elizabeth Sanger, who wants to become a US representative in Congress for your district. Unfortunately, the team discovered that you're a software developer, so they have begged you to build an application that lets them track volunteers, and store information about Elizabeth and her campaign.

Your job is to define the different objects and arrays, their structure, and the corresponding properties for each, to represent the following information about Elizabeth's campaign. All of these properties should live under a variable called elizabethSanger. This variable should be equal to an object.
